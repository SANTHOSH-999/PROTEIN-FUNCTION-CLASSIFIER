           Machine Learning Algorithms </strong>The essence of machine learning  algorithms lies  in  development  of  models from  the  existing  data  and subsequently,  classification  and/or  prediction  using  novel  data. 
           Methods  based  on  machine  learning algorithms are  grouped  into  two  classes; namely,  supervised  and  unsupervised.  In  supervised  learning, predefined class  labels are  available for all the training examples. 
           This  labeled training data is used  to build a model, which is used to predict the class of new input data. In unsupervised learning, predefined class  labels  for  the  training  examples  are  not  available. 
           The  basic  aim  of  unsupervised  methods  is  to discover the patterns hidden in the input data and group (cluster) the data appropriately...
